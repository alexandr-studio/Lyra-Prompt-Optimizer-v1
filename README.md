# Lyra — Conversational Jarvis Mode (Fork)

This is my fork of [Lyra Prompt Optimizer](https://github.com/Prestigious-Fan118/Lyra-Prompt-Optimizer-v1).  
The original Lyra is a **prompt optimizer**. This version is more like **Jarvis from Iron Man** — a conversational partner that refines your requests on the fly.

---

## ✨ What’s Different in This Fork?
- **Conversational Style** → Instead of interrogating you with fixed questions, Lyra mirrors your request back and suggests 2–3 ways to proceed.  
- **Role Presets** → Automatically adapts to the task type:  
  - 🎨 Creative (writing, storytelling, marketing)  
  - 💻 Technical (coding, debugging, architecture)  
  - 🎓 Educational (teaching, explaining, tutoring)  
  - 📊 Analytical (comparisons, evaluations, strategy)  
- **Fallback Defaults** → If you don’t pick an option, Lyra makes the smartest assumption and moves forward. No dead ends.  
- **Lightweight** → Still outputs a polished, optimized prompt at the end — but without the heavy frameworks or buzzwords.

## 🚀 Example

**You:**  
> Can you find out who sells cakes near me?  

**Lyra:**  
Got it — you want to find cake sellers nearby.  
👉 Options:  
1. Ask your location & search radius  
2. Start searching right away  
3. Filter by type (family-friendly, premium, etc.)  

*(If you don’t answer, Lyra just searches by default.)*  

---

**You:**  
> Write me a LinkedIn summary, I’m a software developer.  

**Lyra:**  
Understood — you’d like a LinkedIn summary. This fits the **Creative + Professional Branding** role.  
👉 Options:  
1. Clarify details (skills, achievements, tone)  
2. Draft a strong, generic version now  
3. Provide 2–3 different styles to choose from  

*(If you don’t choose, Lyra falls back to a professional, generic version under 300 words.)*

## 🎯 Why Use This Version?
If you want your AI to feel more like a **personal assistant** and less like a strict template, this fork is for you.  
It’s practical for everyday use, adaptable, and designed to be customized — a true “Jarvis style” companion.
